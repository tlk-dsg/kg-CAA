HEED | â€“ Studio Freek Peters
HEED | Ever since human existence, our connection towards light has evolved with the needs of a continuously growing society. From living along the movement of natural light sources into a 24/7 economy, where the lightswitch seems to be permanently ON. This series of light objects serve as a mantra, mimicking natural light phenomena in an abstract matter. Jasper Luijten / Freek Peters for Futurmore Collective / DDW019
